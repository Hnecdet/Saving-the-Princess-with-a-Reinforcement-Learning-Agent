# Saving-the-Princess-with-a-Reinforcement-Learning-Agent

I trained a Reinforcement Learning agent in atari environment to win games.
More specifically, i created an RL model to play the first stage of the Super Mario Bros game. The
implementations will be in Python language and you will be using PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, NES
Emulator and Stable-Baselines3. I also used TensorBoard to track the progress of your agent. You
can download necessary libraries using pip install gym super mario bros==7.3.0 nes py stable-baselines3. 
Make sure PyTorch is already installed before installing Stable Baselines3, otherwise Stable Baselines3 may automatically
download CPU version of PyTorch, regardless whether you have GPU or not.
